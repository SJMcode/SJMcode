👋 Hi, I'm Safir, a software developer with a strong focus on problem solving and front-end development.

👀 I'm particularly interested in the MERN stack and Python, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills.

🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by learning C++, Python, and JavaScript, with a focus on MERN stack development.

💞️ I'm actively seeking open source projects that require expertise in JavaScript, Python, C++, and React, and I'm excited about the possibility of collaborating with other developers to build something great.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me at safir.jameel@gmail.com if you want to discuss potential collaborations or just connect!
